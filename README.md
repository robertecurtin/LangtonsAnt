https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

`antwalk_display` will display an 11x11 window of the ant's progress across 2000 iterations.

`antwalk_display_with_graphics` will display a 16x12 animation of the ant's progress. You will need the dependencies from [lua-display-grid](https://github.com/robertecurtin/lua-display-grid.git) to run it.

`antwalk.lua` contains the implementation.

`antwalk_spec.lua` contains the tests.
